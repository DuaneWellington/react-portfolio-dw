Greetings! 

I'm Duane, a Software Engineer with a distinctive journey that began in the challenging environment of Syncrude, Fort McMurray, Alberta, where I progressed from a laborer to a skilled Labour Foreman, cultivating strong leadership skills.

Transitioning to carpentry, I undertook an apprenticeship and earned the title of Red Seal Endorsed Journeyman Carpenter, mastering precision and craftsmanship. My journey extended into real estate, excelling as both a realtor and a licensed mortgage broker, providing me with a profound understanding of property transactions and negotiations.

Now equipped with skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL, MongoDB, and React, I seamlessly blend problem-solving and creativity in code. Whether in Alberta's industrial sites or the digital realm, my diverse background ensures a unique perspective.

Let's not merely build; let's innovate together. I'm Duane, prepared to craft excellence in every line of code! üõ†Ô∏èüè°üíª

A list of future features

I will be converting to a single-page format and plan on making a number of design tweaks as a result, such as color palette, and introducing an all-encompassing design theme as opposed to a couple of disperate design elements. Also, I will be adding a Contact Form that uses React to email me when a user fills out the form and clicks the submit button. I envision a website that feels modern, has touches of animation in some of the elements and perhaps the background as well. I'll be taking inspiration from several of the portfolio websites we were shown during our last Outcomes session. Some of them introduced a design strategy that seemingly created a gamified user experience. I'll be looking to design and implement something similar in function to that.
